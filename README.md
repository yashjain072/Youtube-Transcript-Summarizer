# Youtube-Transcript-Summarizer
Minor Project

INTRODUCTION 

Enormous number of video recordings are being created and shared on the Internet through out the day. It has become really difficult to spend time in watching such videos which may have a longer duration than expected and sometimes our efforts may become futile if we couldnâ€™t find relevant information out of it. Summarizing transcripts of such videos automatically allows us to quickly look out for the important patterns in the video and helps us to save time and efforts to go through the whole content of the video.
One application of text analytics and NLP is Text Summarization. Text Summarization Python helps in summarizing and shortening the text in the user feedback. It can be done with the help of an algorithm that can help in reducing the text bodies while keeping their original meaning intact or by giving insights into their original text.
